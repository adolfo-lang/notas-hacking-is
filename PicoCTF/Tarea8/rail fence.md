## rail fence

# objetivo
- A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher). Here is one such cipher encrypted using the rail fence with 4 rails. Can you decrypt it? Download the message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/272/message.txt). Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, `picoCTF{decoded_message}`.

# Hints
- Once you've understood how the cipher works, it's best to draw it out yourself on paper
